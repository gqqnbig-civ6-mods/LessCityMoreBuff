# 城数少有加成 Less City More Buff

文明6似乎只能爆铺了？别说单城，三四座城已经很难在高难度下撑到后期了。玩法太单一了！

本模组为精铺或单城挑战打通更多可能性。

本模组模仿文明5的科技、文化开销随城市数递增的特点，从反方向处理，就是城市数越少，对科研和文化的加成越多。一座城每个时代有30%加成，例如古典时代有60%。如果一座城撑到信息时代，加成则为240%。如果一共有两座城，则远古时代的加成为20%。一直到有四座城，加成减少到0。

阈值设为4，因为一项奢侈品能给4座城供给，城市数少于4，奢侈品就浪费了。

Civilization 6 is wide-play only? Not to mention the single city chanllenge, having three or four cities is already very difficult to sustain to the later stage under high difficulty. The winning strategy is limited!

This mod opens up more possibilities for playing tall or even single city challenges.

To imitate the mechanism of Civilization 5 that the cost of technology and the cultural scale with the number of cities, the mod gives more research and culture bonus if you have less cities. A city has a 30% bonus per era, for example, 60% in the classical era. If your civalization with one city suvives into the information age, the bonus is 240%. If there are two cities in ancient Era, the bonus is 20%. Until there are four cities, the bonus is reduced to 0.

The threshold is set to 4, because a luxury resource can supply 4 cities. If you don't have 4 cities, pieces of the luxury are wasted.
